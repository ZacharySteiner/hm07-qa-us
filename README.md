# Sprint 7 project

Urban Grocers API.

The purpose of the project was to test inputs through Javascript and GitHub through automated testing

To download dependencies, after cloning from GitHub, run npm install

Gererate a fresh server URL and save it between the parenthesis of config.js

To run the test suite, open a terminal and use npx jest

In this project, I was testing the api/v1/kits/:id DELETE endpoint, the api/v1/warehouses GET endpoint, the api/v1/kits POST endpoint, and the api/v1/kits/:id endpoint.

I was testing the response code and the response body of each input. I used node.js, Java Script, and Postman to test them.
