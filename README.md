# Sprint 7 project

Urban Grocers API.

In this project, I was testing the api/v1/kits/:id DELETE endpoint, the api/v1/warehouses GET endpoint, the api/v1/kits POST endpoint, and the api/v1/kits/:id endpoint.

I was testing the response code and the response body of each input. I used node.js, Java Script, and Postman to test them.

To execute tests, pull up the terminal and use npx jest.
